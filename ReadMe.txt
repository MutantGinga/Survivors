Unreal Engine version number: UE 5.2.1

Instructions:

The game is best when run as the packaged .exe file. It is capped at 30fps, so should not be intensive at all on the hardware used for testing.

This is a prototype demo of a top-down 2D roguelite. You play as a knight who must survive waves of enemies for 5 minutes. If you survive, you win! If you are finding it hard to win, kill enemies and collect the coins they drop to upgrade your main weapon. You can spend coins to upgrade your weapon in the shop at the main menu.

Controls:

W: move up
A: move left
S: move down
D: move right

CTRL: pause

weapon fires automatically (like Vampire Survivors), so it doesn't require any input!
